Hello Connection!!
I am happy to inform you that I have completed the Fifth task of the Prodigy Internship
In the the problem statement was as follows-

Problem Statement: Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors
The dataset which I employed for this purpose was the titanic dataset as mentioned above.
The link for the dataset is as follows- Dataset

Analyzing the number of accidents with respect to various factors such as the weather,time of day whether it is a day or night and some other factors that would be crucial for the number of accidents to occur. The visualization allows us to know where the accidents are occuring in a large number. The analysis can be also viewed for a particular time period as well as the severity of the accidents can be analyzed.
